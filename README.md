Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process designing,building,testing and mantaining software.
Helps in building Reliable systems
For solubility and efficiency
For security and data protection
Saves on cost and time efficiency

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of software engineering-1968
The term software engineering was first used in NATO conference to adress the software crisis project were running late,over budjet and full of bugs 
The developement of structured programming-1970
Developers like Edsger Dijksra introduced structured orogramming,breaking software into smaller managable parts.Languages like C and pascal emerged
makind coding  more oranizedand reducing errors.
The Agile Revolution-2001
The Agile manifesto changed the game by promoting flexibility,collaborations and first iterations.Agile methods like Scrum and Kanban replaced
slow,rigid processes,helping teams deliver better software faster.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning-Defining the project scope,goals and feasibility
Requirement analysis-Gathering and documentingwhat the software should dobased on user needs and business goals
Design-Creating the system architecture,user interface and technicalspeculations
Implementation-Writing the actual code based on design specifications.
Testing-Checking for bugs,errors and performance issues
Deployment-Releasing the software to users
Mantainance and Updates-Fixingbugs,by improving features and keeping the software up-to-date to meet changing user needsand technology trends.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Approach
Waterfall follows a linear,step by step processs where each phase where each phase must be completed before moving to another phase while Agile  is iterative and flexible allowig teams to work in cycles and make adjustments alon the way
Flexibility
Waterfall is rigid-once requirements are set,changes are difficult and costly while Agile is adaptable,making it easy to modify features based on feedback where used
Waterfall is best for projects where requirements are well defined and unlikely to change e.g in developing software for medical devices requires  srrict panning,documentation and compliance,making waterfall a suitable choice.
Agile is ideal for projects that need flexibility and frequent updates.For instance,building a mobile app or SaaS platform benefits from Agile iterative approach allowing developers to adjust features based on user feedback
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
A software developer is responsible for designing,coding and implementing software solutions based on roject requirements
Debugging and fixing software issues
Quality Assurance Engineer
He/She ensures the software is free of bugs and meets quality standards before release
Designing and executing test plans
Project manager
Ensures that developers,designers and QA testers work together to meet the launch deadline.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is a softwareapplication that provides tools for writing,testing and debugging code in one place e.g Visual Studio Code
It increases productivity due to featureslike autocompletion
For code management
Version control Systems e.g GitHub,Bitbucket
A tool that tracks changes in a code,allowing multiple developers to collaborate without usingprevisious versions
For collaboration
For code history and backup

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping up with rapidly evolving technologies
Challange,New programming languages,frameworks and tools emerge constantly, making it difficult to stay updated
Strategy,Follow tech blogs,attend webinars and takeonline courses
Meeting tight deadlines
Challange,Software projects oftenhave strict deadlines,leading to stress and potential burnt out
Strategy, Use Agile Methodologies
Break tasks into smaller ,managable pieces with clear priorities.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing,Tests individual components or function of software in isolation
It ensures that each module or function works correctly
System Testing, Tests the entire application as awhole to verify that all components work together correctly
Validates the software against functional and non-functional requirements
Acceptance Testing,Evaluates the software from an end-user perspective to ensure it meete business requirements and is ready for deployment
Comfirms that the software meets the customer expectations
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
ItsA the practice of designing and refining text inputs to effectively communicate with AI models and generate the most accurate,relevant and useful responses.
Importance
Improves Response Accuracy
Enhances AI efficiency
Enables Cuatomization and control
Enhances AI/Assisted Decision-Making

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about space"
Improved prompt
"Describe the formation of galaxiesand explain the role ofdark matter in their structure and evolution"
Why improved prompt is more effective
Its more specific
Clear expectations
Concise yet detailed
